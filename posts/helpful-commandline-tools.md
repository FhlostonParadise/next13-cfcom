# Helpful Command Line Tools

Learning to use the command line effectively is a skill that both developers and server administrators need. This is one area where there is a lot of overlap in these tradtionally different roles. As DevOps continues to blur the borders between the 2, the benefits to being comfortable using the command line become even more clear. Here are some utilities that I have found helpful.

## [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr)

Shorter 'man' pages with more examples on how to use the commands.

## [duf](https://github.com/muesli/duf)

duf is great for showing info about mounted disks and checking free space. It produces a clear and colorful output, and includes options for sorting and customizing results.

## [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

fzf (Fuzzy File Finder) is an extremely powerful, and easy to use fuzzy file finder and filtering tool. It lets you search for a string or pattern across files.

## [procs](https://github.com/dalance/procs)

procs is an easy to navigate process viewer, it has colored highlighting, makes sorting and searching for processes easy, has tree view and updates in real-time.

## [bandwhich](https://github.com/imsnif/bandwhich)

Show bandwidth usage, connection information, outgoing hosts and DNS queries in real-time. Not the most detailed or feature rich display, but it certainly puts the most important information front and center. Great for troubleshooting.
